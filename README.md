**Project**

The final project will comprise an Exploratory Data Analysis of a dataset of your choosing using the numpy and pandas tools.

**Team**

Form a team of 2 to 3 students. This project was completed with Joshua Fram and Wilford Bradford.

**Data Analysis**

  * This project is relatively unguided. You will come up with your own interesting questions that you can answer using the variables in your dataset, then perform an analysis based on those questions.
  * You can analyze either an instructor-approved dataset of your finding or one that we have pre-approved. You may join several datasets together. For example, you might combine two datasets to answer questions like, "Is felony crime higher in NYC after 2 days of rain?"
  * This project emphasizes the exploratory and descriptive techniques covered in class. Although some of you have a background in statistics, we ask that you avoid any statistical inference or other advanced techniques. In particular, this means that you should confine your analysis to the sample of data you have, and avoid making statements about the population that the sample comes from.
